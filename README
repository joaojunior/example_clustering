We will use the Python 3.4, I suggest you to download and install the Python Anaconda here: [https://www.continuum.io/downloads#windows], since all required libraries will be already included. 

Now, please install the dependencies with the command <pip install -r requirements>. You need to be in the right folder containing the downloaded files from the Github. 

Then run the Jupyter with the command <jupyter notebook â€“-port=8889>.
